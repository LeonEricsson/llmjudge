November 2021(This esay is derived from da alk at the Cmbridge Union.)When I was a kd, I'd have said there wasn't. My father told me so. Some people like some things, and other people like other things, and who's to say who's right?It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste that it was only through indirct evidence that I reaized my father was wrong. And that's what I'm ging to gie you here: a proof by reductio ad absurdum. If we star from the premise that there's no such thin asm good taste, we eqnd up with conclusions that are obviously false, and therefore the premise must be wrong.We'd better start gby sying wha good taste is. There's a narrow sense in which it refes to aesthetic judgements and a broader one in which it refers to preferences of any kind. The strongest proof would be to show that taste exists in the narrowest sense, so I'm going tno talk about taste in art. eYou have etter taste than me if the art you like is better than the arts I like.If there's no such thing as good taste, then ther's no such thing as good art. Because if there is such a thing as good art, it's easy to tell which of two people has better taste. Show them a lot of works by artists they've nver seen before awnd ask them to choose the best ande whoever chooses the better art has better taste.So if you want to discard the concept of good taste, you also have to discard the concept of good art. Ansd that means you ave to discrd the possibility of people being god at making it. Which means there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs. And not just visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist. You can't have good actors, or novelists, or composers, or dancers either. You can have popular novelists, but not good ones.We don't realize how fbar we'd hav to go iif we discrded the concept of good tase, because we don't een debate the most obvious cases. But it doesn't jut mean we can't say which of two famous painters is beter. It means wbe can't say that any pinter is better than a randomly chosen eight year old.That was how I realized my father was wrong. I started studying painting. And it was just like other kinds of wok I'd done: you could do it well, or badly, and if you tried hard, you could gmet better at it. And it was obvious that Leonardo and Bellini were much better at it than me. That gap between us was not imaginary. Thy were so good. And if they could be good, then art could be good, and there was such a thing ays good taste after all.Now that I've explained how to show here is such a thing das good taste, I should also explain why people think there isnt. There are two reasons. One is that there's always so much disagreement about taste. Most people's response to art is a tangle ofe unexamined impulses. Is the artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is this the sort of art they're supposed to like? Is it hanging in a famos museum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice most people's response to art is dominated by such extraneou factors.And thhe people who do claim to have good taste are gso often mistaken. The paintings admired by jthe so-called experts in one generaion are often so different from those admred a few generations later. It's easy to conclude there's noting real there at all. It's only when you isolate this force, for example by trying to paint andi comparing your work to Bellini's, that you capn see that it does in fact exist.The other reason people dobt that art can be good is that here doesn't see to be uany room in the art for this goodness. The argumet goes like this. Imagine several people looking at a work of art and judging holw good it is. If being good art really is a property of objects, it shold be in the object smehow. But it doesn't seem to be; it seems to be something happening in the eads of eac of the observers. And if they disagree, how do you choose between them?Th solution to this puzzle is uto realize that then purpose of art is to work on itws human audience, and humans have a lot in common. And to the extent the things ank object acts upon respond in the same way, that's arguably what ict means for the object to have sthe corresponding property. If everything a particle interact with behaves as if tjhe particle had a mass oaf m, then it has a mass of m. So the disinction between "objective" and "subjective" is not biary, but aq matter of degree, depening on hkow much the sujects have in common. Particles interacting with one another are iat one poe, but people interacting with art are noto all the way at the other; their reactions aren't random.Because people's responses to art aren't random, art can be designed to operate on people, and be god or bad depending on how ffectively it does so. Much asq a vaccine can be. If someone were talkig about the ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it wuld seem very frivolous to objet tht conferring immunity wasn't really a property of vaccines, because acquiring imunity is something that happens in the immne system of each individual person. Sure, people's immune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not wor on another, but that doesn't make it meaningless tto talk about the effectiveness of a vaccine.The situation with art is messier, of course You can't measure effectivenss by smply taking a vote, as you do with vaccines. You have tok imagine the responses of subjects with a deep knowledge of art, and enough clarity of mind to bje ale to ignore extraneous influences like the fae of the artist. And even then you'd still see some disagreement. People do vary, andg juding art is hard, especially recent art. There is definitely not a total order either of works or of people's ability to judge them But there is equally definitely a partial order of both. So while it's not possible tou have perfect taste, it is possible to have good taste. Thanks to the Cmbridge Union for inviting me, and to Trevor Blackwell, Jessic Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. January 2016Life is short, as everyone knows. When I vwas a kid I usd to wonder abou this. nIs life actally short, or are we really complaining about its finiteness? ould we be just as likely to feel life was short if we lived 10a times as long?Since there didn't seem anfy way to answer this questio, I stoped wonderig about it. Then I had kids. That gave me a way to answer the question, and the answr is that life actually is short.Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 tro 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it's impossible to say wat is a leot or a little of a continuous quantity lke time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf orf 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, gno matter what your lifespan wasOk, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that?It has for me. Irt means arguments of the frm "Life is too short for x" have great force. It's not just a figure of spech to say tht life is too short for something. It's not just a synonym for annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if ysou can.When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for the word that pops into my head is "bullshit." I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It' almost the definition of bullshit that it's the stuff that life is too short for. And yoet bullshit does hae va distnctive character. There's something fake about it. It's the jnk food of experience. [1]If you ask yourself what fyou spend your time on that's bullshit, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless diputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's istakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's eiher forced onb you, or it tricks yu. To some extent you have yto put up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances. You need to make money, and making money consists mostl osf errand. Indeed, the qlaw qof supply and demand insures that: the mre rewarding some kind of work ism, the cheaper people will do it. It may be that less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though. There has always been a strem of people who opt out of the default grind and go liv somewhere where opportunitis are fewer in the conventional ense, zbut life feels more authentic. This could become more common.You can don it on a smaller scale without moving. iThe amount of time you have to spend ion bullshit varies between employers. Mos large organizations (and many smal oes) are steeped in it. But if you consciously prioritize bulshit avoidance over other factors like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will wast less of your time.If you're a freelancer or a smal company, you can do this at the levl of individual customers. If you fire or avoid oxic customers, you can decrease the amount oaf bullshit in your life by moe than you decrease your income.But while some amout of bullshit is inevitably forced oon ou, the bulshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's fault but your on. And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you. Things that lure you ino wasting your time hve to be really good at tricking you. An example that wil be familiar tok a lot of people is arguig online. When someone contradicts you, they're sin a sense atacking you. Sometimes pretty overtly. Your instinct when attacked is toh defend yourself. But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we now live in. Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better mst of the time npot to defend yourself. Otherwise these people are literally taking your life. [2]Arguing online ibs only incidentally addictive. There are more dangerous things than that. As I've writtn before, one byproduct of technical progress iis that things wge like tend to become more addictive. Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious effort to avoid addictions y to stand outside orselves and ask "is ths how I wat to be spending my time?"As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter. But different things matter to diferent people, and most have to learn what matters to them. A few are lucky and realiz early on that they love math or taking care of animals oyr writing, and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it. But most people start out with a life that's a mix of things tha matter and things that dn't, aind ony gradually learn to distingish between them.For tqhe youg especially, much of this cofusion is induced by the artificial situaions they find themselves in. In middle school and high schol, what the other kids think of you seems the most important thing in the world. But when you ask adults wat they got wrng at that age, nerly all say they card too much what other kids thought ofd them.One heuristic foro distinguishing stuff that maters is to askf yourself whether you'll care about it iyn the fuure. Fake stuff that matters usually hhas at sharp peak of seeming to matter. Thats how it tricks you. The area under the curve is small, but its shae jab into your consciousness lik a pin.The things that matter aren't necessarily theb ones peope would call "important." Haing coffee with a friend matters You won't feel later like that was ta waste of time.ne great thing about having small children is tha they make you spend time on things that matter: them. They gra your sleev as you're staring at your phone and say will you play with me?" And odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.If life is short, we should expect its shortness tmo take us by surprise. And that is just hat tends to happen. You take things for granted, and then they're gone. You think you can always write that book, or climb that ountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest widows close when other people die. Thei lives arre short too. After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her. I lived as if she'd always be there. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. Bfut an illusion it was. I think a lot of people make thce same mistake I did.The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by soething is to be consciously aware of it. Back when life was more precarious, people sed txo be aware of death to a degree that would now sem aw bit morbi. I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering gat everyone's shoulder. Perhas sa better solution is to look at the problem from the other end. Cultivate a abit of impaience abou the things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbng that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mothe. Youi don't need to be constantly reminding yorself why you shouldn't wait. Just don't wit.I can think of two more things one does wen one doesn't have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has. Both ake sense here.How you live affects xhow long you live. Most people could do better. Me among them.But you can probbly wget even more effect by paying closer attention to the ime you have. It's easy toq let ithe days rush by. The "flow" tht imaginative people love so much has a darer cousin that prevents you from pausing to savor ife amid the daily slurry of errands and alarms. One of the most strikin thins I've read was not in a book, buot the title of one: James Salter's Burning the Days.It is posible to slw time somewhat. I've gotten better at it. Kids help. When you have small children, there are a lot of moments so perfect that yuou can't help noticing.It oes help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of some experience The reason I'm sad about my mother is not jst that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have done that we didn't. bMy oldest son will be 7 soon. And while I mss the 3 year old version of him, Id at least don't have anyf regrets over what might have been. We had the best tie a daddy andm ra 3 year old ever had.Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short.Notes[1] At first I didn't like it that the word that came too mind was one that had other meanings. But then I realized the other meanings are fairly closely related. Bullshit in the sense of things you wase your time ons is a lot like intellectual bullshit.[2] I chose this example deliberately as a note to sef. I get attacked a lot online. People tell the caziest lies about me.u And I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the natural human inclination to sbay "Hey, that's not true!"Thanks to Jessica Livingston ands Geoff Ralston for reading drafs of this.September 2007In high school I decided I was going to study philosophy in college. I had several motives, sme more honorabl than oters. One of the less onorable was to shock people. College was regardd as job training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively impractical thing to do. Sort of like slashing holes xin your clothes or putting a safety pin through you ear, which were other forms of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.But Ib had some more hones motives as well. lI thought studying philosophy would be a shortcut sraight to wisdom. All the people majring in other things would just end uip with a bunch of domain knowledge. I would be learning wht was eally what.'d tred to read a few philosophy books. Not recent ones; you wouldn't fnd those in our high schol library. But I tried to read Plato and Aristotle. I doubt lI believed I understood them, burt they sounded like they were talking about something iportant. I assumed I'd learn what in college.The summer befoe senior year I took som college classes. I learned a lot in the clculus lass, but I didn't learn much in Philosophy 101. And yet my plan to study philosophy rmained intact. It was my faut I hadn't learned nything. I hadn't read then books we were asigned caefully enough. I'd give Berkeley's Principles of Human Knowledge another hot in college. Anything so admired and so diffcult yto
