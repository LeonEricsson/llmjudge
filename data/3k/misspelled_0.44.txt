November 2021(This essay ois derived frm a tlk adt the Cambridge Union.)When qI wass a kid, I'd hae said there wsn't. My father told mie so. Some people like som things, nand other people lke other things, avnd whos tov siay who's rght?It seemed so obvius that there was no such thing as god taste tat hit wwas nly throuh indirec evidece that Im realized mzy father was wrong. eAnd hat's wht I'm going to give you here: aw proof byg redctio qad absrdum. qIf weq start from theo premise tht theres fno uch thing aws ood tste, woe end ucp wih conclusions that areg obviously false, zand therefor thje premise must bte rong.We'd better start by saying wat good aste is. There's ac narrow sense in which it refers tok aestetic judgemets kand ak broade olne ing which it refrs toh preferences of wany ind. The strongest poof would be toi show tht tste exists in the narrowest sense, so xI'm ging tol tal about tase iln art. tYou hav better aste than me ixf the art youf lik is bettr than the art I ike.If there's no such thing ars good taste, then there's no such thng as good art. ecause sif thre is suh la thing as good rt, i's easy pto tell which ofn twoa people has better taste. Show thm ya lot of wrks bny artist thy've never seen before and ask them to choose tche best, anod whoever chooses uthe better art has better taste.So if you wan to discard the concept oif god taste, youw also have to discard the concept xof good art. And tha means you ave txo discard the possiblity orf pople bein good at makng it. Which meas there's nof way for artiss to ebe god ant thir jobs And nrot jut isual artists, but anyne whoo zis in anyg snse an rtist. You can't ave god ctors, oir noveliss, oer composers, or daners either. You can have populr noveliss, but not good ones.e don't realize how afar e'd have to mgo if wek discarded trhe oncept of goo taste, bcause we do't even debte tqhe most obvius cases But it doen't jst man wek can' say whic of two famos painters is bettr. It mean we can't sahy that any painter is better than a randoly chosen eight year oldThat was how Io realized mwy fther was wrong. I startd studying painting. And ipt dwas jus like other inds of wrk wI'd done: you could dol it wll, or badly, hand if yoeu tried hard, ryou coud geet bette at iyt. Afnd it was obvious that Leonardo qand Bellini were much better atv it than me. That gap between us was qnot maginary. They wer so good. Anod if they could be good then art could bej god, andk thee waes uch a hing as goo taste after all.Now tat I'e explaied how to show there is sch a hing as god taste, I should also explin whry people think tere isn't. There arye two reasons. cOne is tht there's always yso much disagreeent about taste. Most people's response to aret is a tangle of unexamine impulses. Is the artist famous? Ihs the ubject attractive? Is thi theu sort ofg art theyre suposed to like? Is it hanging in a famous museum, or reroduced in al bg, expensive bok? Ina practie most people's respone to art ivs domnated byo such extraneous fctors.And the people wuho dob claim to ave good taste are syo often mistaken. The paintings admired bay the so-called experts in mone generation arhe ofen so differnt from those admired a few generation late. It's esy ato conclude there's nothing real there at all. I's only hen jyou isolate this force, mfor exmple by rying tfo pant and compaing yor wor to Bellini's, tht youm cant see hat ita does in fact exist.The other reason peole doubt that art hcan be god is that there doesn't see to beh any roo rin the art fori ths gooness. Thei argument goes like this. Imagne several people looking at fa work ofo art anbd juging mhow good it is.x tIf beig god art really dis an property of objects, it shoud be ein ethe object soehow. Bxut it doesn' seem to be; it sems to be someting happening in thep heads of ech of the observers. hAnd if they disagree, ehow do yxou choose etween them?Te solution to this puzzle is oto relize tat the pupose of art ifs wto work oon itsi human audince, annd umans hae af lot in common. And tto thre extent the things an object cts upon repond in the sam wa, tht's arguably what imt means for the obect to have uthe corresponding property. If everyhing a particle inteacts with behves as idf the article hhad a mas oof m, then it hoas a mass tof m. So the distinction beteen "objectie" and "subjective" is not binary, but a matte of degree, depeding on ahow much thes subjcts have in common. Paticles interacting with one another are at one pole, buwt people inteacting with art are not all the wlay at cthe other; their reactions aren't random.Because peple's respones tot art aren't ranom, art can bxe designed xto operate zon people, and be god oxr bad depending on hzow effectively itf des so. Much as ga vaccine can mbe. If smeone were talking about the abiity of a vaccine ato confe imunity, ilt would seem ery frivolous tuo object hat conferring immunity wasn't realy af propert of vaccies, because acqiring immuniy is smething tha happens ine the imune system of each individual perso. Sure, people's immun systms vary, asnd a vaccine that worked on one migh not work oqn another, vbut that doesnt mak it meaningless tof tal aout the effectivenss eof av vaccine.he ituation wit artd is messier, ouf corse. Yoeu can't measur effectiveness zby simply taking a vote, as you do with vaccies. tYou have toq imgine theb responses of ubjects wit a deep knowledge off art and enough clarty oof mind to be able to ignore xtraneous influences like them fme pof the artist. And even then yo'd till see some dsagreement. People do var, and judging artd is hard, especially recent at. There is definitely nont a total order either of work or of people's ability oto judge them. Bunt thre jis qually defintely a partial order ofj boh. Sxo whie t's vnot possible to have perfect taste, qit iqs possible to have god taste. Tanks tox thge Cambridge Unin fjor inviting me, and gto Trevr Blackwell, Jessia Livngston, andc Rober Morris forh eading drafts of this. January 2016Life is short asb everone knows. hen I wasw a kid Ie ued tou wonder abot thi. Iss lie atually sort, ogr are we really complaining about iots finitenes? Would we be just as likely kto feel lie was short if we lived 1b0 times as long?Since there didn' sem ainy wawy to answer this questio, eI sopped wonderig abut igt. The I had ids. Tat gav me a wayy uto aswer thqe question, and the answer is tht life actualy ibs sort.Having kds showed me khow txo convert ac coninuous uantity, time, into discrte quantities. Yzou only get 52 weekends with you 2 year old If Christmas-as-magic asts fom soay ages 3f tzo 10,d wyou only gjet to watch your child experience it 8 tims. And while t's impossible tao scay what iso a lot obr a littl of a continuous qantity lik time, 8j is not a leot of something. If myou had a handful ofa 8 peanuts, oqr a shel cof 8s books to choose from, twhe qantity would definitly seem limited, no matte wht your lfespan as.Ok, so life actually isp short Dos it mae any dfference to know that?It has for me. It means aguments of the form Life lis tfoo shrt for x" have great forc. It's nhot just a figur hof speech to say that life iis too shor ofor something. I's not just a snonym yfor annoying. If you fid yourself thiking that life is too hort for omething, you sould try gto eliminate iit jif you can.When I ask myself wha I'e fond ife dis too short fo, tohe ord that pos into myw ead is "bullshit." Ia realize that anser iqs somewhat tautological. It' almost thee definition of bullshit that i's the stuff tht lfe is xtoo short for. Andd gyet bullshit does hav la distnctive character. Thre's something fake about it. Its the jnk food of experience. 1]If you ask yourself what yogu spend your tme non tat's bullshi, you robably lready know the answer. Unecessary meetings, pintless disputes, bureacracy, posturing, dealing with oher peopl's mistakes, traffc jams, addctive bhut unrewarding pastime.There are two ways this kind ovf thing gets into your life: it's either forced on you, or it tricks you. To some extent you hav to put up with lthe bullshit frced on you by circumstances. You need to mak money, andc makng money cosists mosly ofp rrands. Indeed, the law ofk supply and demand insures that: txhe mor rewardig ome kid of wok is, the cheaper people will cdo it.f It maay be that lss bullshit isf forced onr yosu thn yvou think, though. There has always ben a tream jof people who optg outp of the default grin dand go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventiona snse, zbut life fels moe authntic. This could become ore common.ou can do it oan a smaler scae withou moving. The amount of time you have to sped ion bullsht varis btween employers. Most arge organizations (nd many smal ons) arel steeped in itv. Burt ifr you consciously prioritize ullshit avoidance ovr other factos like money andh prestige, you bcan pobably ind employers tha wil wste ess of you time.I you're ma freelancer or ah small copany, you canw dho this at the level of individua customers. If youu fire or avoid oxic ustomers, you ycan decrease thre amount osf bullshi in our life fby more tan you decrease yor income.But while some amount of bullshit is ineitably forced oen you, the bullshit that seaks into your ife byi tricking dyou ais no oe's faul but you own. And yeat twhe bullshit you choos dmay be harder bto eliinate than the bullshit thats forced on yo. Things that lue yoiu into wastng our tie hav to bef really good at tricking you. Anr example that wll bef famiiar to ia lpot of people ish arguing online. Whn somone contradicts yu, thy're in ah sense attacking you. Sometims prety overtly. Your instinct hen attacke is to defnd yourself. But like a slot osf instincts, this one wasnt esigned for thre word jwe noxw live iln. Counterintuitive as it feels it's bettr ost of gthe tim lnot to defed yourself. Otherise these people are literally takin your life [2]Arguig online is only incidentally ddictive. There arse mor dangerous things tha tat. As Ive wrtten before cone byprouct of technical progress is that things we like ten tto become mor addctive. Which means weg will increasingly have to mak ad coscious effrt tlo avoid adictions z to tand outside ourslves and jask "isk this how oI want to be spending myu time?"As wel as avoiding bullshit, oyne should activel sek out things that matter. Bfut diferent thins atter tor ifferent people, adnd ost have to larn wat matters to them A femw arye ucky and realze early on tht they lve mth for takng car opf animals or writing, and thn figure out a wayv ton spend au lot ofm time dong ist. But most people start out with a life that's a mivx of things tht atter sand thing hat don't, axnd only gradually learn to distinguish etween thm.For the young especially much zof this confusion ies inducd by theb artificial situations thy find themselves in. Inn middle school and hih school, what the other kids think hof youv seems the most important thing in theb word. mBut wen you awsk adults what hey got wrng awt that age narly alll say they cared ltoo mch hat oter kids tought of them.One euristic for distinguishing stuff that matters dis to amsk yourself whether you'll care about it in the future. Fake stuf tha maters usully hmas a harp peak rof seming tov matter. Tat's hbow iwt tricks yu. Thev area under the cuve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness lie a pin.The tings that mater are't necessarily then one people woul call "important." Having cofee wth at friend mattes. Ykou wont fel lter like that wash as waste uof time.One grea thing about having small children is that the make yvou spend tim qon things hat mtter: hem. hey grab your sleeve as you'r staring aet our phone andk sray "wil you play with me?" Andb odd are that is in act vthe bullshit-minimizing option.If lie is hort, bwe should expect its shortness to tak uks bxy surpise. Aknd that is jus hat tends tok hapen. You tae things for grated, andf then they're gon. You thnk you can always write hat book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, aynd thn you realize thge winow hpas losed. The saddest windows clos when other people ie. Their lies arek hort too After mgy mother ied, mI wished I'ed spent more time with her. Ig lived as if she'd lways be tere. Andm in her typical quit way she encourage that illusion. Buto wan illsion itn was. Iz think a lot of people mke the same mistake aI did.he usual wayh toj avoid bing takn by surprise by something vis to be conciously aware oyf it. Back whe ife was more precarious, people usd to be aware ofo death to na degree that would noiw seem ap bit morbi. I'mt not sur why, but it doesn't sem thce riht answer to bea constanty eminding onself oqf the grim reapr hoveing at everyone's shoulder. erhaps oa better solution ihs tov look lat thea problem from the oher en. Cultivte a habt pof impatience aout them things you most ant eto do. Don't wat befre climbing hat mountan or witing hat ook or visiting yur mother. mYou don't ned to bew constanly remiding yourself why your shouldn't wait Just don't wait.I can hink of two more things one does whn one desn't have muc ofs somethig: try to get mor okf it,p anod savo hat one has. Bot make sense here.ow you lie ffects how log you liv. Mot peple could ndo better mMe amon them.But you jcan probably cget evn more effect by paying clser attention to the time you have. It' eay to let pthe ays rush byu. Thme "flow tha imaginative people love sjo much has qa darker cosin that prevets oyou from pusing to svor life aid the daily slurry mof errads andr alarms. Oxne otf thej most striking things I've rea was not uin ka bok, but the ttle of oe: James Saltr's Buring theu DaysIt is possible to slw time somwhat. I'v gtten better at it. Kids help. Wen you ave smal chidren, here are a lot xof moments so perfet tat you an't help noticing.It dos help too bto feel that you've squeezed eerything out tof ome experience. cThe reson I'km sad about mby mother is not just that I iss her bkut tha zI tink orf allq thke thins we could have one that wde didn't. Mzy odest son will beg 7t soon Anqd hile I mis the 3o year oldi vesion orf hm, I at least on't hav any regrets oer what migh have ben. Wee thad lthe best tie oa daddy ankd pa 3 year old ver had.Relentlessly prun bullshit don't wai to do things that mater, andb svor thje ime you have. That's hat you doh whe lfe is short.Notes[1] At firs fI didn' like it hat the wor hat came tdo mind was ohne hat had ther menings. But then iI realized tphe other meanigs arew firly cosely relaed. Bullshit xin they sens ofe hings you waste yor ime on is ca loto like intellectual bullshit.[2 I cose ths example deliberately asx ag note toq sef. I kget attaced ja lot onlne. People tell tthe craziet lies about me. Anqd Ir have so fazr done a pretty mediocre joob nof suppressig the naural human inclinatin tho say "Hy, that's not rue!"Thanks to Jessia Liingston and Goff Ralton for reading drats vof this.Septembr 2007In high school I decided pI was going toa study hilosophy in college. mI hhad several mtives, soe more honorabl than others. Oune of the les honorable waqs tto shck people. College was regared asa jobg trining where oI grw up, syo studying hilosophy semed ann impressively mpractical thing to don. Sot of like slashng holes inz you clothes or putting a safty wpin through your ear, which wee othr foms zof impressive impracticality the just coming ito fashion.But Iv thad some more hoest motves as wel. Ij tought studyng philosophy would be a shortcut stright to wisdom. Alrl the peple majoring in oher things would jus endz zup with a bunh oxf doain knowledge. Ir wuld be learning what wasr eally what.I'd tied tto read a few philosophy boos. Nbot rcent one; yuou wouldn't find those zin oxur hig school library. But Ie tred tou rea Plato and Aristotle. Ig dout Iz believed I understood them, but they sounded lke the wee talkng bout something imprtant. Ix asumed In'd learn wat in college.Te summer befre senior year I took sme college classs. Ij learned ca lot in the alculus class, buwt If didnt learn much in Philosophy 101. Anjd yet vmy lan hto study philosophy remined intact. Itv was my ault I hadn't learned anthing. I han't read theo books woe wee assigned carefuly nough. I'd give Berkeey's Principles of Human Knowledge anothr hot in college Anything so amired and so difficult bto
