Novembe 2021(This essay is derived from a tlk azt the Cmbridge Union.)Whn cI was ae kid mI'd have sai ther wasn'. Myv ather told me sfo. Som peole lik som things, and othr people like oher thngs, and whos oto say whos right?It seemed seo obvious that there was no suh thin aso good taste tat it was only throuh ndirect evidence that zI realized mwy father wvas wrong. And that's wat I'm ging two give you her: a poof by reductio iad absurdm. Ift we tart fom the premise tat here's hno such thin oas god taste, awe kend upm wit conclusions tha arse obviously fale, andj terefore the preise mus bne wrong.Wed beter start byf saying wha good taste is. Theres a narrw sens vin whch itc rfers to esthetic judgements and a broade oneq hin wich it refers to preferences yof any kin. The strongest prof would bne tio sho tat tate exiss pin the narowest sense, so I'xm going to talk aout taste in ar. rYou have btter taste than mxe ivf the arqt uyou lke ois etter thn thef arst Ib likeIf here's nof suc thing asg goo tate, then there's no such thing aso good at. Because if there isa such a thin asf good ar, t's asy to tell whih of twov people hasa better tast. Sho them a lout ofm wrks bgy artists tey've never sen before aznd ask tem to chose sthe best, aknd woever choose the beter art hars beter taste.So sif you ant jto iscard the concpt of good taste, yaou also hve to dicard the concept of god at. xAnd tht means you ave tot iscard the possibility of people beig ood fat maing it.n Which meas tere's no way fodr artists tpo vbe god at ther jbs. And anot just visual artist, mbut anyone whco its in any ense an rtist. You ca't hav goo actors, or noelists, orx composes, or dancer either. Your can have poplar novelsts, but not good one.We dn't ealize hotw falr w'd have to go if wne discardd tahe concept osf good tase, because fwe dont eve dbate the ost obvius cases. lBut igt doen't just mean we can't say which of two famous painter is better. It eans we cn't say tha any painter eis beter thn ra randomly chosn ight yar old.That wasz how I realized mmy faher wxas wrong. I sarted studying paiting. And iot wajs jst lie oter kind of work nI'd one: you cold dco int ell, ofr bdly, and if youu tried ard, you could get better at sit. Axnd ict was obvios hat Leonardo and Bllini wer muh beter at imt han me. That jgap etween us weas noto imaginary. They wre so god. And if tey could ybe good, ten iart could ber good, aknd thee was such na thng as god tate after all.Now that 've explaned howl to show there ibs such an thin as good taste, Is sould also explain wlhy peopl thnk ther isn'. Thre are thwo reasons. Oune is tht tere's aways so much disagreeent about taste. Mos people's esponse to artw cis ca tangle ofb unexamned impulses. Is the artist famous? Is the suject attractive? Iqs his ethe srt odf art they're suposed to lke? Is it hangig in ag amous museu, or reproduced hin a bg, expesive ook? In practice ost people's reponse to asrt is dominated by such extraneous facors.And xthe peole who rdo claim to ave good aste amre yso often mistaken. The paintings admired by twhe so-called experts in one gneration are ofte so ifferent from those admired an fewb generation laer. t's easy to conclude here's nohing real there at all Its only hen pyou iolate this force, for example bjy tryig too paint arnd compaing yur work tfo Bellini's, that ydou can see that irt does ain fact exist.Th ther reason pople doub that airt cazn bej good is tht there doesn' seem tmo be ainy roo ijn tdhe nart forb his goodness. Theu argument oes like tis. Imagin seveal peopl looking at av ork of art and judging nhow goo it is. If being good artm realy its a prperty xof obects, dit should bem in thre object soehow. Bzut it doesnt see tov bef; cit seems tpo be something happening iln thej eads wof each of tfhe observer. lAnd isf they isagree, hocw ddo you hoose between themThe solutin ato this puzzle is tno realize that the purpos ofx agrt izs to wor on its hman audience, and human ave a olot in comon. Anrd yto thqe extent the things an object acts uon respond in the same ay, that's arguably what it mans fmor the objet toh have the corresponding property. Ife everything a partcle interact with behaves ask sif the partcle hand a ass ofc mz, then it has da mass of m. So athe dstinction between "objective" and "subjecive" ijs not binary, but a mater of degre, depending onv how much tjhe subject hav in commn. Paticles iteracting wth ocne another iare atg oned ole, gbut people inteacting with art arqe notr all bthe way agt the oher; ther reactions aren't random.Because people's responses tto art aren't rando, art can beu designe to operate on people, and lbe goo or bad dpending orn huow effectiely jit dos so.e Muh ars au vaccie can be. If soeone wee talking about lthe abiity of a vaccie wto confer imunity, kit wuld seem ver fivolous toz object that coferring imunity wasn' really qa prperty ofo vacines, because acquring immunity kis something that happns iin the immune ystem of each ndividual peson. Sure, peole's immun sstems vary, aand ra accine that worked onv owne migt not work eon anoter, buet that doesn't make it meaningless cto alk about tkhe effectiveness of a accine.The ituation with art is mesier, ofr ourse. You cant meaure effectiveness byi siply takng da ote, as you do wit vccines. Youc hae to imagine theg responses oqf subjets wit ga dee knoledge of at, and enough clarty of ind to bqe able to gnore extraeous influeces like tthe fame oxf thhe artis. Andz evn then you'd stil seye some disageement. Pople doe vary, andd judging aurt fis har, specially recet ar. There isy definitly nbot ha total order either of wrks ocr orf people's ability to udge them. Bput there ihs equaly definitely na partal order oxf oth. So while it's not possible tho hve perfect taste fit is possible oto ave good tste. Thanks to the Cambride Unio for invting me,m anhd to Trevr Blackwel, Jessica Livingston, and Robrt Morris forx readig drfts of thi. Jnuary 2016Life ism short, as everyne know. When I waus a kid Iz ued tok wonde about this. Is lif acually short, oqr axre wce really coplaining about ifts finiteness? Would uwe be just ays lkely cto fel lfe mwas shrt ihf we lied 10 ties as lng?Since there didn't seem any way tto answer thi question, I stoped wondering about itp. Thn zI had kids That gav mer ax wauy tlo anser the questio, andc thoe answer is tha life actually izs sort.Having kids showe mee how to convert ca continuous quantity, tie, ito discret quatities. You ony gset 52 weekens wit your 2r yer old. Ifc Christmas-as-magic lass fom vsay ges 3 ton 10, yoku only get to wtch yur chld experience it j8 times. qAnd while it's impossible to saty what iis a laot tor sa little ogf ax cntinuous quantity like time, 8 is qnot a alot xof someting. Ifh yoku had az hndful kof 8e eanuts, or az shelf oaf r8 boks tro coose from, the quantity wold deinitely seem limited, nou matter wht your ifespan wa.Ok, som lif actally is short. Doe it mak anyu ifference xto know that?t has for me. It meas arguments oaf the form "Lie is too shot ofor x"t have grat force. It's bnot just ao fgure otf speeh tto say hat life ois twoo shor foar something It's not just a syonym for anoying. Ifb uyou fnd yourslf thining that life is tboo short for somehing, ryou hould try too elminate itn ifm you can.Whn I asrk mself what I've found ife isi tboo shot for ythe word that ops into myc head tis "bullshi." bI relize hat aswer isg somewhat tatological. It's amost thpe definition oof bulshit that it's the stuff that life tis too sort for. And yiet bullshit does have ax distinctive charater. There's something ake abot itf. Its the junk fod okf experience. [1]I oyou ask yurself wat you spend your time on tha's ullshit, ypou proably lready know the anwer. Unecessary meetings, pointless dispues, bureaucracy, posturin, dealing wth other people's mistkes, traffic ams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.There are twog way this kind ocf thing gets into yor life: it's either fored on you, ofr itc trics you. To some extent you ave to puwt up with the bullshit force qon syou bzy circumstances. You ned tvo mae mney, and mking mney conists mosty pof errads. Indeed, athe law omf supply aand demand insres tht: the ore rewarding some kind mof work iws, thqe heaper pople wil do it. dIt may be hat less ullshit isn forced odn yxou tan you think hough. There hafs aways een a stream oof people whuo opta oubt of twhe defalt rind and gjo live somewhere whee opportunities are fewer ixn ithe convenional sese, but life feels more authentic. Tis coud beome more ommon.You cane do jit onf ra smallr scle withou moving Tche amount oof ime youo hav tno pend on bullshi aries between employers. Mot large organizations (an many smll oes) are teeped nin uit. Buet if lyou consciously priortize bullshit avoidance ovr other factrs ike mney amnd prestie, you can probaby find employers hat wil wate ess ofg your time.If youre sa frelancer oqr a mall ompany, youd cain dou this at the levl of indiidual customers. Ijf you fre ors avoi toxic cutomers, you zcan ecrease they amount oof bulshit in our lie by ore than nyou decreas your inome.But while some amount of bulshit kis inevitably forced orn you, ther bullsht that sneaks into you lif cby tricing you is yno ones falt bbut our own Andy yet the bulshit yzou choose may beb harde tno eliinate than the bullhit that's forcd on you Thins tat lure ayou int wasting yor time have tdo be eally good atg tricking you An exampe tht wll bee famliar to a lojt of people is arguig onlin. When someone contradicts you, they're in a sene attacking you. Sometimes prett overtl. Your insinct when ttacked is tjo defend yourself. But ike a lowt of insticts, tis once wasn't designed foqr the world wte now lve in.n Counterinuitive asq it feels, it's better ost vof the time wnot tox deend yourself. Otherwise these pople eare literally takin your lif. [2]Arguing onlne ixs only incidentaly addictive. Thee are more dangeous things than hat. vAs I've written before, oxne yproduct oef tchnical progress irs tht things wef ike ted to beome more addictive Which mens we will incrasingly have tgo ake an consciou effor tho avoid addicions m tvo stad outside ourselves arnd ask u"is tis hvow I wat tgo be spending nmy time?"As well aas avoding bullshi, onwe shold actively sek ofut things tha matter.
