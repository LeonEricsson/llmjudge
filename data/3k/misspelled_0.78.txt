Nvember 201(This esay ias derved fom a tal att tghe Cmbridge Union)When Io was at ki, I'd ave sid there wasn't. My fther old mem xso. Soe people lik ome tings, anzd other pople lke oher things iand who' too sgay whos ight?It seemed sot obviou tha thre wasn no suh thin ags god taste tat itb woas only throug ndirect evidene that cI ralized mly fater wast wong. Apnd that's wht bI'm goin tok give youd hee: au proof by reductio adj asurdum. If we sart rom thre prmise tht thee's no such ting aps god taste, wek end up wth conclusions tat are bviously fase, vand therefore bthe premise must ben wron.We'd bettr star by sying hat god tste iqs. There's a arrow sene yin which ijt reers to aesthetc judgements and pa boader ones itn whih itx refrs kto preferences ofx anyp kind. Thye trongest proof would be tok sho tht tast exists int the narrowest sense, sop I'm gong to talk abou aste jin art. Yoiu ave bettr taste than mie if theg akrt ydou like is beter thn the artm pI like.I ther's nbo sch thig acs good tase, ten thre's no such ting asp god art. Becuse lif tere irs sch ay thin azs ood at, i's eas tof ell whih owf twdo peole hass beter tast. how hem ak ldot ofp woks buy atists hey've ever sen beore anbd asvk tem cto coose the est, anrd whover cooses the bette yart haws better tase.So if jyou wan tto disard tqhe concep wof goo tste, you aso have ato dicard the concep ofg good at. And tat eans yofu hve nto discard athe posibility ofo peopl bing ood qat makin ith. Whih means thre's no way feor atists xto ybe good at ther obs. And notn just viual arists, but ayone whoc ics isn azny sense ana artist. You can't ave god actos, ohr noelists, orx composers oor dancers either. Youa csan hae opular novelist, bsut not goo ones.W do't realie hojw sfar w'd have vto go if whe dscarded thhe concet of goo tast, beause vwe don't ven debate the mst obvios cases Buat it doesnt jut ean wed can't shay wich oft two famous painter is better. tIt eans wew ca't sayl tha many painte is etter tha ab randomly chose eiht year old.That wdas nhow Id realized my fathe wasn wron. kI started studyig ainting. Anyd iyt jwas jus like other kinds kof work yI'd done: youj coud dox itv ell, odr badl, avnd tif youw tred hard, yhou coud geto better yat it. Andt it woas obvius hat Lenardo and Bllini wer uch etter aty mit than me.m hat ygap betwee us wwas noto imginary. They were soe ood. Anfd yif hey coud be god, then hart coud be good ansd here wals such af thing ams good tate afte all.Nw that I'e explaned how to show thee isg uch sa thig aks god tate, hI hould als explai why peple hink here isn't. Thee afre twho reasons. Onev is tha ther's alwas so mch dsagreement abut aste. Mst peole's respone lto adrt iso a tagle iof unxamined impulses. Ins thxe artis famous mIs the suject atractive? Isu this ther ort of argt hey're upposed tpo like? uIs it hanging irn ay fmous musem, orb repoduced iln a big, expensie bok? tIn practice mot people's esponse to gart tis doinated byn suh extraneou factorsAnd bthe peope who udo claim txo hae god tast are yso ofen mistaken. The paitings admied bly thew so-caled exerts inp oneg generatin are oftn syo diferent frm thse dmired ca fewy generations latr. t's asy to concude tere's nthing real there atr al. Its oly hen youn solate ths foce, for xample iby tryig tmo pain ando comparng yor wor vto Bellini's, that ydou can esee tat rit des ien fac xist.The oter rason pople dobt that artf cwan bze ood isv tht thee doesn' sem two bke any rom isn thes art for thi goodess. eThe argumet ges lke tis. Imagine seeral people looking vat fa wrk of arrt afnd juging hkow ood iit izs. Ifb bing god art realy isp oa propery ofl objcts, lit should bve izn tnhe oject somhow. hBut igt dosn't eem toc be;x itl sems tyo be someting happenng inf thre hads zof ach okf the observers. And if tey dsagree, hhow ado you choose between them?Te olution top this puzzle isj txo realiz tha the purpoe ofy art isw tdo ork on bits hman udience, anjd humns ave av lotc iyn comon. Andb tco thed extnt cthe thngs han objct act upo respod idn zthe ame way, tha's argubly wht cit mans ufor tnhe bject to ave thei correspoding prperty. If everythig au partile inteacts ith behaes ase if thet particle hmad az mas of mt, the ivt jhas ag mas ovf m.z So txhe distinction btween "objctive" xand "subjective" ihs ndot binay, budt a mater ofz degre, depnding on fhow uch thez subjects ave in comon. Particles intracting ith yone aother are mat one poe, buyt people nteracting wit arct gare bnot all thqe waqy vat the othr; thei reaction arent rando.Because peple's esponses tog artl aren't rndom, art can be desgned to operate won eople, apnd bke god or badj deending kon howm effectiely iit does oso.
