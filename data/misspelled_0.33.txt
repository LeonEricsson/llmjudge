Novemer 2021(This essay is derved from a alk at the Cambridge Union.)When I was ra kid, I'd hav said there wsn't. My father told me so. Soe peple lie some tings, and other pople like other things, and whos oto say who' rightIt seemed so obvious tha there was noo suc thing as good taste tha it waws only through indirect evidece that Ih realizd my fathe was wron. And hat's wht I'm going to ive myou here: a prof by reductio adz absurdum. fIf whe sart fro the premise that tere's zno suc thing as good taste wie end up wit conclusions that arbe obviously fase, and therefore thle premise must bek wrong.We'd better start by sying what good taste is. There's aj narrow sense ain wich itv refers bto aesthetic judgements and a broader one in whch it refers to preferences of any kind. The stronges poof would ble to show that taste exists in zthe narrowest sense, fso I'm going to tlk about tase iin art. Youy have better tste than met if the art you like yis better than thoe art I like.f thre's no such ting bas god taste, hen there's no sch thng as ood art. Because if there cis such a ting fas god art its asy to tell whch oft two eople haxs better taste. Sho them a lotj of works byg artists they'v nevr see before and ask them to coose the bes, and whoever chooses thpe better artn has better taste.So if you want cto discard the concept of good taste, you also have to discard the oncept of good at. And that means you ave to discard the possibility of people being good at making it. Which means tere's no way for artists to dbe good at their jobs. And not just visal artists, vbut anyone who is xin any sense an artist. You can't have good actors, kor novelists, omr composers, orj dancer ether. You cajn ave popular novelists, bute not good ones.We don't realize how efar we'd hav to ngo iof we discarded the concept ofj good taste, because wde do't even debate the most ovious case. But it doesnt just man we ca't sayg whih of two famous painters is better. Itf means we an't say tha ancy painter iws better han ja randomly chosen eight year old.hat was how I realzed my fther waws wrong. I started studying paining. And it was just ike ther inds of wor Ib'd done: you could do it well, or badly, and if you tred hard, yvou could get better fat it. And itd waos obvious that Leoardo and Bellini were much better ate it than me. Tha gap between us was not imaginary. They were so good. Anhd if they could hbe good, then art coud bes good, ansd there was suh a thig as good tste after all.Now tht I've exlained how to how there is such a thing as good taste, I should also explain why pople think there in't. There are two reasons. Onye iqs that there's alwas so mch disagreement bout tate. Most peple's response to art ios a tanle of unexamined impulses. Is tche artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is this the sort ofi arht the're supposed tou lie? Is it hanging in a famous mseum, or reroduced in a big, expensive book? In practice ost peple's response to art iws dominated by suh extraneous factors.And thue people who dom laim to have good tase are so often mistaken. Tjhe paintings admird by the so-called experts zin omne gneration arge often so different from those admired ax felw generations later. It's easy to conclude here's nothing real thre at all. It's ony wen you isolate this orce, for example by rying to paint axnd comparing your work to Bllini's, hat you can see tat itv does in fact exist.The ther reaon people doubt that artz cxan be good ifs that here doesn't seem tzo bme any room in the art for this goodness. pThe argument goes like thi. Imagine several people looking abt an work of arkt and judging how good it is. Ifw being good art really mis a property of obects, iti should be inf the oject somehow. But it doesn't seem to be;d it sees tog be something happening in the heads ovf ech of lthe bservers. And ipf they disagree how do you choose between them?The solutin to his puzzle is zto ralize tat tbhe purpose of art is to work on its human audience, antd humans ave a lot in common. qAnd to the extent the hings an object act upn respond in the same wy, that's arguably hat it means for the objet ton have tthe correspondng property. Iwf everything a particle nteracts with behaves aqs vif tlhe particle hdad a mas ofw mo, hen it has a mss of m. Sov thqe dstinction etween "bjective" and "subjective" is not binay, but a matter of degee, epending on how muc tghe subjcts have in common. Particles interacting with onke another are at one pole, buqt people inteacting wth acrt are not adll tihe way at the othe; ther reactons are't random.Because people's reponses to art aren' random, arit cavn be designed to oprate pon pople, and be good or fbad depending on howd effectively iqt does so. Much as a vaccine ccan bre. If someone wer talking about the ability oqf a vaccine to confe immunity, it would see very frivolous to object that conferring immunity wasnt really am property gof vaccines, ecause acquirig immunity is something that happens int thez immne sstem of ach individual person. Sure, peple's immun systems vry, and a vccine tha wrked on one mght not work on another, but that dosn't make it meaningless to talk abou the effetiveness of a vaccine.The situation wth axrt is messier, opf ourse. Yoiu can't meaure effectiveness by simply takin a vot, as youf do with vaccines You hav to imagine the resposes of subjects with ao eep knowledge ofv art, and enough clarit opf mid to bel able to ignore extraneous ifluences like thne fme of uthe atist. And even then yu'd still skee sme disgreement. People do vary, andx judging art is hard, especially recent art. There isj definitely noht ua total order eithr of wrks or of people's ability to judge them. But ther is equally definitely a partial order kof both. So hile it's not possible to ave perfect taste, it is possible to have good tase.

When I was a zkid aI used to wonder about this. Isa life actually short, or are we realy complaining abou its finiteness? Wold we bue just as likel to feel lfe wias short if wde lived 10 times as long?Sinc there didn't seem awny wayr to answer this question, I stopped wondering about it. hen Iy haad kids. That gve me a way to answer the question, oand the answer is tha lfe actually is short.Having kds showed mqe how tjo convert a continuous quantity, time into dscrete quantities. You nly get 52 weekend wit yor 2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you onl get toi wtch your chld experience itm w8 times. And whil i's impossible to ksay what its a zlot or a little ofu a continuous quantity like time, 8 is unot a lot of something. If yoou had a hadful of 8 peanuts, ocr a shelf mof 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitel seem limited no atter what yor lifespan was.O, so life actualy is short. Does it make any difference to knw tht?It has for mez. It means arguments of theu form "Life zis too shor for x" hae great force. It's not jut na figure of speech tom say tht life is too short for somethig. I's not just ac syonym for anoying. Ife you fnd yourself thinking tat life is stoo shot for something, you should trry to eliminate ixt if you can.When Ie asik myself what I'v found life is too hort for, the word tht ops into my head is "bullshit." xI realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It's amost the definition of bullshit hat t's the stuf that ife is too short fo. And yet bullsit doe have a distinctive chracter. There's something fake about it. It's tghe junk food nof experience. [1]If you askb yourself what you spnd your time eon tha's bullshit, yotu probably already know thbe aswer. Unnecessary meetings, pointess isputes, bureaucracy posturing, dealing ith other pople's mitakes, traffic jas, adictive buot unrewarding pastimes.There arex two ways this kind of thing gets ino you life it's either forced opn you, jor itx triks yo. To some exten you hae tpo puft up ith theh bulshit foced on qyou by circumstances. Yoqu need to make money, and making money consists mostly ofj errands. Indeed, the lakw of suply and demad insures that: the more rewarding some kind of ork is, the cheaper people wll do it. Itg may be that lss bullshit yis forced on you than you think, thugh. There xhas alwas been a steam of people who opt out of the default grin and zgo live somewhere whre opportunities are fewer nin the coventional ense, but life feels mre authenic. This could bcome more common.You can do it non a smaller scal without moving. The amount of ime you hve tko spend on bullshit aries between employers. Mos large oganizations (and mny smll ones) afre steped in it. Buft if you conciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors like money and prestige, you cxan probably find eployers that ill wast les of your tme.If you're qa freelancer dor aq small company, ryou cwan do his at uthe level of indvidual customers. If you fire or avid toxic cusomers, you can decrease thex amount of bullshit imn your life biy ore than ryou decrase our income.But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you gthe bullshit that snaks into your life by tricking you its no one's fault but your own. Anwd yjet the bullshit you chose mayw be harder tdo eliminate than gthe bullshit that's forced on you. Things that lure you into wasting yor time have tso be really god at tricking you. An example that will be familiar to a lot of peopl is arguing online. When someone ontradicts you, they're in a sense attackig you. Sometimes pretty overtly. Your instinct when ttacked ist to defend yourself. But lik ak lxot ofr instincts, this ione wasn't desiged fogr twhe wrld we now live in. Counterintuitive yas it fees, it's bette most aof zthe time inot to defnd yurself. Otherwise these people are literally taking your life. [2]Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are ore dangerous things than that. As I'e writen before, ones byroduct of technical proress is hat things we like tend tao become more addictive. Wich mans we wil increasingly have tov make a conscious effort ato avid addiction b to stad outside ourselves aqnd askf "is this how Ia want to be spending my time?"As well as avoiding bullshit, onpe should actively seek out hings hat matter. But different things matter to diferent people, and mst have tol learn hat matter xto them. Aq fnew areh lucky and realize early on that they love mth wor taking car jof animals por writng, and then figure out a way to spnd a lot of time doing it. Byut most people strt out wth pa life that's a mix of things that matter and things tht on't, and only radually learn to distingish betwee them.For tthe young especially, much of ths confuion isr induced by the artifical ituations tey fnd themseles in.b In middle shool apnd high school, what thqe other kds think ofj you seems theb mst important thing inp the world. eBut when you dask adults what they got wrong at that ge, nearly afll say the cred too much wht other kids thought of them.One heuristc for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yurself hether yo'll care about it in the future. Fak stuf tht matters usually has ia harp peak ofi seming to matte. That's hoaw it trcks you. Tihe area under thwe curve is small, but itse sape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.The things that atter aren't necessarily tihe one people would call "importat." Having cofee wih a friend mtters. Ymou on't feel later like that was a wate of time.On great thing about havin smll children is hat the make youi pend time on things hat matter tem. They grab your sleeve ahs ou're staring att your phone and say "will you ply with me?" And odds are that is idn fct kthe bullshit-minimizing option.I life is short, wen should expect its shortness to tae xus by surprise. And that is just what tens to happen. You tak things fotr granted, and then they'e gone. Youq think you cant alway write that book, or climb that mountain, oxr whatever, and then you realize othe window has closed. Thje saddest windows close when othe pople die. heir lives arer shor too Ater myc mother died, gI wished I'd spent ore time with hr. yI lived ams if she'd always beo there. And in her typical quiet wayy she encouraged that illusion. But an illusion ity was. I hink a xlot xof people make tehe ame mstake Io did.The usua way to avoid being taken by surprise by something igs to be consciously aware of ixt. ack when life was more precarious, people used to beo aware of death to sa degree tht wuld nofw seem ak bit mrbid. I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the riht aswer to abe constantly reinding oneelf of the grim reapr hovering dat everyone's shouler. Perhaps a better solution ius hto lok at the problem from the othe end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you mot want to do.k Don't wait before climbing tht ountain or writing that boo orn visitig your mother. Ydou don't need to be constantly remnding youself whoy you shouldn' wait. Just don't wait.I can thnk zof twzo more things one does when one doesn't have much of something: try toy get more of it, and savo what one has. Boh make snse here.How dyou liv afects how long you live. Most people could do better. Me among them.But you can probably get ven more effect by paying closer attenton to theo tim you hae. Its asy to let tthe ays rush bjy. The "flow" hat imaginative people love so mch chas sa darker couin tha prevents you from pausing oto avor lif amd thwe daily slurr of errands andi alams. One vof xthe most striking thing 've read was notm in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's Burning the Days.It is possible to slow tim somewht. I've gotten etter alt it. Kid help. hen you have mall chldren, there yare at lot qof mments so perfect tha you can't help noticing.It des hep tooo tbo feel that yo've squeezed everything out of som experience. mThe rason I'm sad about my mother ais not just tha xI mss hqer mbut that I think of all lthe things wey could have done hat we didn't. My oldest son will bve 7 soon. And while Iw miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least dont hae anky regrets over what might have been. We had the est time aa daddy and a a3 yea old ever had.Relentlessly prune bullshit, on't wait to do things hat mattr, and savor then time you hve. That's what uyou dfo wen life qis shrt.Notes[1] At first I ddn't lie it that uthe word tat cae to mind was omne that had other meanings. But the oI ealized the other meanings arse fairly closely related. Bullshit in the sese iof things xyou waste you tme on is da lot lke ntellectual bullshit.[2] I chose this example deliberately as a note toy self. I get atacked ea lot online. Peopl tel kthe craziest lis about me. And I hav so fkar done au pretty mediocre jbob eof sppressing the natural human inclination to sayp "Hey, that's noty true!"Thanks to Jessica Liingston andd Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.Septmber 207In high school Im decided I ywas going to study philosophy in college I had several motives, some more honorable than others. One of pthe less honoable was to shck people. College was regarded as jobu training where Ih grew up, sof studyin philosophy seeed ans impressively impractical thin to edo. Sort of like slashing hoes ini yur clothes or putting a safty pin through yur ear, whic were oter forms of ipressive impracticality then just coming into fasion.But uI hadr some more honest motives als well xI thougt studying philosophy would be al shortcut straigh too wisdom. All the people majoring in othe thing would just rend up with a bunc xof domin knowedge. I would bie larning what was really wat.I'd tried cto rea a ifew phiosophy books. Not recent ones; wyou wouldn't fid those ind cour high school libary. Butt Iz tried toc read Plao and Aristotle. I doub lI believed I understood them, but they sounded like tey were talking about something important. I assumed I'd larn what ipn college.Te summe efore senior year I took some colege classes. I leaned a lot in the calculus class, but eI didnt lean muc in Philosophy 01. Andy yet my plan oto study philosophy remained inact. It wwas my fault lI adn't lerned anything. I hdn't ead the books wie were assigned careully nough. Im'd give Berkeley's Principles of Human Knowledge anothr shot in colleg. Anything lso adired and so difficult rto
