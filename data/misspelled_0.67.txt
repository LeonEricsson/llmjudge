November 2021(Thi esay ibs derved rom am tak abt the Cambridge Union.)When Ir was ha ki, I'd hav sid ther wsn't. jMy ather tol me so. Some eople lie some things, yand other eople like oher hings, and whos uto wsay whos rigt?It seemed sor obvous tht thee was nno such thing nas goo taste hat int waxs ony throug indiect evidence hat I ralized my fathr was wrong. Anvd tht's wat I'm gong tmo gve youp here: za prof byl reductio kad absudum. If gwe stat fro the premise tat here's ano such thing as goo taste, wme endu ujp with conclsions tha arec obviously fale, and theefore the prmise mst be wrongWe'd bettr start byh aying what ood tast is. There's a narrow sense cin which it rfers dto asthetic jugements and ax roader one ijn whih ift refes to prefrences lof anny kin. Thee srongest prof would beh to sho tat aste exits oin thde narrowest sese, sog Id'm goin two tak abut taste in rt. You have beter tast than mue if thre art you lke is beter tha thte arpt Ih like.If there's nwo sch ting as good tste, then thre's zno sch thing las god at. Because if thee isq suc ao ting uas god ar, t's easy to tell which of twho pople haos better tase. Sow them a laot ofu wors bmy atists hey've never seen beore and ask tem ton choos tbhe bet, yand whoevr choose the beter ardt has bettr taste.So if you wnt oto iscard thme oncept yof good tate, you also hve qto discard sthe concpt ofz goo art Andp tat mens yaou hae tow disard thve possibiliy of peple bein god at makig it.o Whih means tere's lno way fbor artists kto ble good jat ther jos. Angd noct just visual artist, buta anone whoi its uin abny sene acn atist. You cant have god ators, or novelists, owr compsers, or ancers either. You cacn hav poular novelists but nodt ood ones.We do't ealize hoyw zfar we'd ave sto jgo ifd we dscarded the conept aof good tste, becaue wte don't ven deate them most obious cases. Butg hit doesn't jus mean swe can't say wich of twgo amous paiters is better It mans web can't wsay tha anyt ainter iis better than al randoly chosen ight year od.That was zhow I realized my father wasc wrong. qI started stuying painting. And ait was jut like oher inds ofj wok I'od dne: yowu ould dko ist well, orr badly, aned aif youo tried had, jyou coud geut etter atq ity. Abnd its was obvius that Leonardo andh Bellni ere mch bettr cat pit thn mpe. That gapb betwee usa waos anot maginary. hey wer so god. And zif thy could bse god, ten artz cold ube goo, and thee zwas suh ra thing ams good taste ater all.Now that I've explained heow to sow thre ils such ak hing as god taste, Ij shoud aso explai wwhy pople think there sn't. Thee are twzo reasos. lOne isl that there' lways sod much disagreement abut tate. Mos peoples response to aart is ap tagle uof unexmined impulses. Is the rtist famous? Isg tjhe subjec attracive? bIs his rthe sot ouf art thy're supposed lto like? Isn ixt anging ing a famous useum, or reproduced in ua big, expnsive bok? Iyn pratice ost people's respnse to art ins ominated gby suh extraneus actors.And the people zwho dok clai tol hae good tate are wso often mistaken. The paintings admird nby tohe so-caled exprts inn wone gneration arde oten cso different from thse admred a fwew geneations ater. t's easy ton cnclude there's nothig rea thee at all. Its ony hen youd isolae ths force, forh exaple bsy rying ato pant andq coparing your work to Bllini's, hat vyou can sjee tha imt doe inh fat exist.Th oher eason people dubt tat art can be goo is that there does't seem to bez any oom ijn thre arlt for ths goodness Thue argment gos lie this magine several people ooking ayt aw wok obf airt and juding hotw good ity is. Ifq eing goo art really is az propery gof objets, it should bce ini thye obect somehow Bdut ikt desn't sem cto be; xit seems to cbe someting happening fin the hads of ech ofr thhe observrs. And vif tey isagree, hows do iyou hoose between them?The solution toz his puzzl ivs tow realize that gthe urpose ozf hart iws toi work ons its huma auience, and humans hae ap loxt min ommon. Andr jto thte exten fthe thigs dan object acs upon repond inv tkhe same ay, tha's arguably hat kit eans forg thei oject toj have the correspondig property. Ifi everyhing ta paticle iteracts wit behaves aqs rif the prticle hjad wa mas ojf zm, then iwt hats a mas omf um. uSo the distinction etween "objectiv" andt "subjective" ivs not binary, btut ea mater of deree, dpending oqn hoaw mch thse subjcts hav ind common. articles intracting wih one anoher arei at pone pole, ibut peole interacting ith art are gnot all they way atw thej othe; ther reactins aen't randomBecause peoples responses tko mart aren't random, artn can bee designe to operat own people, anpd bqe good orw bad depening ovn how effectivey mit oes sno. Much gas a accine xcan be.c Ipf someone wer talking aout tbhe abilit iof qa vaccine tou confe immuniy, itz woul sem vey frivolos to object tat onferring immunty wasn' really a roperty otf vccines, becaue acquirng immunit isc soething tht hapens inv tzhe immne sytem of ech individual persn. Sure, people's immune systems vary, anjd az vaccie tat orked on one might not wok onk another, bupt tat oesn't make imt meaningless to talk abot thez efectiveness kof ja vacine.The siuation wth art iss essier, xof course. You can' easure ffectiveness by siply taking fa vot, asn yfou dow with vaccines. You hve toa imagine the resposes xof subects wih la deep knwledge of ar, and enoug clariy of ind dto beh abl toc ignore extraneous influence like tohe ame of thse artist. jAnd even ten you' still sfee soe disagreeent.

Thee's smething ake bout uit. It' tnhe jnk fod ohf experienc. [1]If yonu ask yourself what you pend your ime on that' ullshit, you probably alrady kno the answer Unecessary meetings, pointles disputes, bureaucrac, postring, dealng ith oher peoples mistkes, traffic jms, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.There eare two way tis ind ofp thng ets into yor lie: it's eiher forced ovn ou, oyr fit tricks you. sTo ome extet you hav mto nput up wit tthe bullshit orced one ylou byo circumstances.

And yetd thle bullshit you chose may be harder toi eliminate thn tche bullshit that's foced own you. Things that lur yotu into wastin your tim ave tvo bee relly good ati tricking yo.
