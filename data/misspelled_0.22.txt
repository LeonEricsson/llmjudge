November 2021(This essay is derived from ca talk at the Cambridge Union.)When I was a kid, I'd have sid there wasn't. My fathr told me so. Some people like soe things, ajnd other peple like oher things, angd who's to say who's right?It eemed so obvious that ther was no suc thing as good taste that it was only through indiect evidence that I realized my father gwas wrong. And that's what I'm going toh give you here: a proof by reducto ad absrdum. If we star from the premise tat there's no such thing as god taste, we end hup with conclusions that are obviously fale, and therefore the premise must bwe wrong.We'd better start bya saying what good taste is. There's a narrow sens in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and al broader one in which it refers teo preferences oyf ajny kind. The strongest proof would bex to show hat taste exists in the narrowest sense, so I'm going to talk abut tase inp art. You hae better taste than me if the art you like is bette than the art I like.If there's no such thing as good taste, then there's no such thing as goo art. Becase if there is such a thing asl ood art, it' easy tlo tell which obf tkwo people has bette taste. Sho tem a lot ofh works by artists they've nver seen before and ask hem nto chooe the best, andp whoever chooses the better art ehas better tasteSo if you want to discard the concept of good taste, youo also hav to discard the concept of good art. And hat means you have to discard the pssibility nof people being good at makng it. Which means there's no wawy for artists to be goo at their jobs. And not just visua artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artis. You can't hae goo actors, or novelists, or compoers, or dancers either. You can have popular novelsts, bvut not good ones.We on't realize how farl we'd have to go if we discarded the concept of god taste, ecause we don't evn debate the most obvious cases. But it desn't just mea wev ca't say which of btwo famous painter is better. It means owe an't saby that any paiter is better tan xa randomy cosen eight year old.That was how If realized my father was wrong. I sarted studying paintig. vAnd it was jst like oher kinds of wrk I'd done: you could do imt well, or adly, and if you tried hard, wyou could get better at it. Andf it was obvious that Leonardo and Bellini were much etter at it thn me. That gap between us was not imaginary. hey were so good. And if the could be god, the aart could be good, and there was such a thing as ood taste after all.Now that Ive explained how tmo show there is such a thing aas good tase, Iv should also explain why people think thee isn't. Thre aare two reasons. One is that there's always so much disagreement about taste. Most peple's response to arut is a tangle of unexamined impulses. Is the atist famous? Is the subject atractive? Is this tlhe sort of art they're suppsed tow lik? Is it hnging in a famous museum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice most people's response to yart is ominated by sch extraneous factors.And the people whom do claim to have good taste are so ofen mistakn. The paintings admired by thhe so-called experts in one generation are often so different from those admired ca few generations later. t's eay tqo conclude thre's nothing ral there at all. It's onl when you isolate this force, for example by trying ito paint land comparing our work to Belini's, hat ryou caan see that yit does in fact exist.The other reason people doubt that art can bie good ims that there doesn't seem to be any room in the art for his goodness. The argument goes like this. Imagine several people looking at ai work ofl artm and judging how ood it is. If being good art realy is a property of objects, it should sbe in the object someho. But it doesnt see tpo be; it seems to be somehing happenin yin the eads wof each of the observers. Anwd if they disagree, hokw do you choose between them?The solution to this puzzle is qto realze that the purpose rof art is to work oun its hman audience, and humans have a lot in common. And oto thew extet the things an object ats upon respond in the same way, that's arguably what itq means for the object to have tshe corresponding property. If everything an particle interacts with behaves as izf the particle had a mass of m,d then it has a mas of m. lSo dthe ditinction between "objective" iand "subjective" is not binary, but a matter of egree, depending on how much the subjects ave in common. Particles interacting with one another are lat one pole, but pople interacting with art are not all the way at the other; their reactons aren't random.Because people's responses tou art aren't random, art can be designd toe operate on people, and abe good or bad depending on how effectively yit does so. uch asi a vaccine lcan be. tIf someone were talking about them ability of a vaccine dto confer immunity, its would seem very frivolous to bject that conferring immunit wasn't really a prperty of vaccines, ecause acquiring imunity isb something that happens in the immune system of each individual person Sure people's immune systems ary, asnd a vacine that worked on one mght nott work on anoher, but that doesn't make iht meaningless to talk about the effectiveness of a vaccine.The sitution with art is messier, of course. You can't measure effectiveness bcy simply taking a vote, asl you do with vaccines. You have to imagin the responses ofl subjects with a deep knowledge ofk art, ando enough claity of mind to be able to ignore extraneous infuences like the fae of the artist. And even ten you'd still see some disagreement. People do vary, andn judging art iss hard, specially recent art. There is efinitely not a total ordr either of works or of people's ability gto judge hem. But thre is equally definitely ya partial order of both. So while it's not possible to have perfect tast, it ais ossible to have good taste.

When I was aq kid I use to wonder abot ths. Is life actually shrt, or are we really complaining about its finiteness? Would we ibe just as likely to feel life was short if we lived 1m0 times as long?Snce there didn't sem any way to anser this question, I stopped wodering abou it. The I hyad kids. That gave me ca way teo answer thie question, andv the answer is that lif actually is short.Hving kids showed me how mto convert a continuous quantity, time, into discret quantities. You only get 52 weekeds wih your k2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts frm say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your cild exerience it w8 times. And while i's impossible to say wht is a logt or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 yis notb a lot ogf somethin. If yoou had a handful of 8 peanuts, for a shlf of 8 books to choose from, thez quantity would definitely seem lmited, no matter what your lifespan was.Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that?It has for me. It means arguments ojf the frm "Life is too short for x" have great force. It's not ust a figure of speech toa say hat life yis too short for something. It's not just a syonym for annying. Irf you find yorself thinking that life ies tyoo short forx something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.When I ask myself wha I've found life is too short for, tzhe ord that pops into my ead is "bullshit." Ia realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It's almost the definition of bullshit that it's the stuff that life is too short fr. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There's something fake bout it. It's tahe junk food of experience [1]f you ask yourself what you spnd your time on that's bullsht, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, poitless disputs, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with othr people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictie but unrewarding pastimes.There are two ways thi kind of ting gets into your life: it' either fored on you, or pit triks you. To som extent you have to puct up with the bullshit fored mon nyou by circumstaces. You need to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands. Indeed, the law of supply and deand insures that: the more rewarding some kind of work is, the cheaper people will do itb. It mapy ube tht lss bullsit is forced eon zyou tan you think, though. There has always been a stream oaf people whof opt out of the default grind and go lie somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventionl snse, but life feel more authentic. This could ecome more comon.You can do it xon a smaler scale without moving. The amount of time you hve to spend fon bullshit varies between emplyers. Most lare organizations (and many smal nes) aere steeped in it. Bdut if you cosciously prioritize bullshi avoidance oer other factors lie money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will waste less of you time.If you're a freeancer nor a small company, you can do this at the level of individual customers. If you fire or avoid toxic customers, you can ecrease the amount of bullshit nin your life by more than you decrease your incomeBut whil ome amunt of bullshit is inevtably forced onk you the bullshit that sneaks into your life byg tricking you is no one's fault but your own. And yet the bullshit you choose mtay be harder to elimiate than the bullshit that's forced gon you. Things that lure you into wasting your ime have to be realy good sat tricking ou. An example that ill be familir tgo la lot of peopl is arguin online. Wen someone contadicts you, the're in ia snse attacking you. Someties pretty oertly. Your instinct whn attacked is to defen yourself. But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn' designed for thet world we nqow live in. Counterintuitive as iet feels, it's better mot of theg time not to defend yourslf. Otherwise these people are literally taking your ife. [2]Arguing online is only incidentally addicive. here are more dangerus thigs than that As I've wrtten before, oney byproduct of technical progress is tat things we like tend to become more addictive. Which means we will inreasingly have to mak xa conscious efort gto avoid addictions  to stand outside ourselves and ask "is this how I want tow bxe spending my time?"As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively see out things that mtter. But differet things matter to different people, and most hve to learn what matters jto them. A few are luky andx realize early on that they love math jor taking care ofp animals ror writing, and then figure oout a way to spend ea lkot of time doing imt. But most people sart out with a life that's a mix of things tat matter and hings that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish between them.For the young especially, much of this confusion is indued by theb artificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and hgh school, what the other kids think of yotu seems the most important thing in the world. But when you ask adults wat hey got wrong at that age, nearly all jsay they cared tzoo much what other kids thought of them.Oe heuristic fokr distinguishing stuff that matters isg to ask yourself whether you'l care about it ifn the future. Fake stuf that matters usually bhas a sharp peak of seeming tgo atter. That's how it tricks yu. The aea under the curve is small, butc its shape jabs ito our consciousness like a pin.The things that atter aren't necessarily wthe ones people woul call "important." Haing coffee with ao friend matters. Yoeu won't feel later lie that was da waste of time.One reat ting abut havng small children igs that they mke yjou spend time ond things tht matter: them. They grab your sleeve as you're staring ant your phone aand say "will you play with me? And odds are that is ino fact the bullshit-minimizing option.If lie is short, we sould expect its shortness to take us bmy surprie. And tha is just what tnds to happen. You take things for granted, and then they're gone. You think you can always write that bok, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then yogu realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other peple die. Their lives are short too. After my mothe died, I wished I'qd spent more tme with her. I lived as if se'd always rbe there. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. But an illusion itv was. I hink ah lot of people make the same mistake I did.The usual wayy to avoid bing takn by surprise by something is to be consciously awar of it. Back when life was more precarious, peopl used to be aware of death toq a degree that would now seem a bit morid. dI'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right nswer to be constanty reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at everyone's shoulder. Perhaps a better soluion is to look at the problem from thhe other end. Cultivate a habit eof impatience about the things jyou most wat to do.c Don't wait before climbing that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mothr. Ysou don't need to be constantly reminding yoursef why ypou houldn't wait. ust don't wait.I zcan think off two more things oneb does when zone doesn't have much fof somthing: try to get more of it, ancd savor what one has. Both make sense here.How you live affects how lon you ive. Most people cold do better. Me among them.But you can probaly jget eve more effect by paying coser attention lto nthe time you hav. It's easy to let the days rsh byy. eThe "flow" that imaginative people love so much has a darker ousin hat prevents you from pausing to svor lie amid the daily slurry of errands andd alarms One of the most stiking things I've read was not iqn a book, but the title of one: James Salter's Burning tzhe Days.It is possibl to slow time somewhat. I've gotten beter at it. Kids hel. When you have small children, thee are ax lot ofp momens so perfect that you can't hel noticing.It does help tofo to fel that you've squeezed everything out off some exerience. The reason bI'm ssad about myd mother is not just that Ih mis her but tha dI think of all the things cwe could have done that we didn't. Msy oldest son will be 7x soon. iAnd while I miss the 3q year old version ofb im, I at least on't have any regrets over wat might have ben. We had the best tme a daddy and a 3 year old ever had.Relentlessly prune bullshit, do't wait rto do things that mater, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life ist sort.Notes[1] At irst I didn't like it that the wrd that came to mid was one that hdad other meanngs. But the I realized the othr meanings ahre fairly closely related. Bullhit in the sense oyf things you waste your time on is a lot lik intellectual bullshit.2] I chose this example deliberately as a note to self. I get attcked a wlot onlne. People tel the crazist ies about me. And Ic have so afar done ka pretty mediocre job opf sppressing the natural human inclination to say "Hey, thats not true!"Thanks to Jessica Livingston and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.September 2007In hgh school I decided cI was going to study philosophy in college. Ia had severa motives, some mre honorable than others. One of thec less honorable wdas vto shock people. College was regarded asg jobj training where Il grew tup, so tudying philosophy seemed an impressively impractical thing to do.l Srt of lik slashing oles in your lothes or putting a safety pin throug your ea, whih were other forms nof impressive impractiality then just coming into fashion.But I had sme more honest motives as wel. I thought studyng philoophy wuld be a shortcut straight to isdom. mAll the people majoring in othe things would just end up with a bunch ofh domain knowledge. I would be learning what was really what.I'd tried to rad a few philosophy book. Notz recent ones; youk wouldn't find thse in our igh scool librar. But I tried to read Plato and Aristotle. I doub I belieed I understod them, but tey sounded like thy wre talking about something important. mI assume I'd learn what in college.The summer befoe senior year I took soe college classe. I learned ae lot in the alculus class, but I didn't learn mch in Philosophy 101. And yet my plan to study phiosophy remained intact. It wzas myg fault I hadn't leared anything. I hadn't read the books we were assigned carefully enough. I'd give Bereley's Principles of Human nowledge another shot in college. Anythin so admired and so difficult to
